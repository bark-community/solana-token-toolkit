# Solana Token Creation Toolkit (PoC)

![Solana Token Creation Toolkit Logo](solana_token_creation_toolkit_logo.png)

Welcome to the Solana Token Creation Toolkit repository! This project offers a comprehensive set of tools, scripts, and utilities for creating and managing tokens on the Solana blockchain. Whether you're deploying SPL tokens for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or other applications, the Solana Token Creation Toolkit provides essential functionalities to streamline the process.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main folders, each serving a specific purpose:

### mpl-metadata

The `mpl-metadata` folder contains scripts and configurations related to managing metadata for tokens. This includes metadata associated with token assets, such as images, descriptions, and other attributes.

### spl-token

The `spl-token` folder houses scripts and configurations for managing tokens using the `spl-token` program. This program provides functionality for creating, minting, transferring, and burning tokens on the Solana blockchain.

### spl-2022-token (Extensions)

In the `spl-2022-token` folder, you'll find scripts and configurations for managing SPL tokens using the `spl-2022-token` Extension program. This program offers additional features and optimizations for SPL token management.

### solanaTX-toolkit

The `solanatx-toolkit` folder contains scripts and utilities from the SolanaTX Toolkit, which provides essential functionalities for transaction management and metadata uploads on the Solana blockchain. This toolkit offers helper functions such as initializing keypairs, automating SOL airdrops, and simplifying metadata uploads.

## Usage

To utilize the Solana Token Creation Toolkit effectively, follow the instructions provided in the README.md file within each respective folder (`mpl-metadata`, `spl-token`, `spl-2022-token`, `solanatx-toolkit`). 

### Example Workflow:

1. **Set Up Metadata**: Use scripts in the `mpl-metadata` folder to manage metadata associated with your tokens.

2. **Token Creation**: Navigate to the `spl-token` or `spl-2022-token` folder and follow the instructions to create and manage tokens on the Solana blockchain.

3. **Transaction Management**: Utilize the utilities provided in the `solanatx-toolkit` folder to manage transactions, initialize keypairs, and simplify metadata uploads.
